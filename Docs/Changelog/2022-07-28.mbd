Now uses the new subproject "MBBuild" by default when compiling packets, if the target has MBSourceInfo.json.

Known issues: Dependancies are only updated if both compilation and linking was succesfull, but as compilation
might fail for any particular source file so is there no way to determine which files were succesfully compiled, so all have to be redone.
